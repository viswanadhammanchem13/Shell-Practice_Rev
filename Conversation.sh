echo "$PERSON1: Hey $PERSON2! Great to see you. You're doing fantastic things—tremendous, really. Space, cars, Twitter—nobody's doing it like you."

echo "$PERSON2: Thanks, $PERSON1. Good to see you too. You’ve definitely left your mark—big headlines, big moves."

echo "$PERSON1: Well, you know me. I think big. But you? Rockets to Mars? Electric everything? That's huge. Maybe we should build a hotel on Mars—Trump Galactic!"

echo "$PERSON2: One step at a time. Let's get Starship fully operational first. But yeah, a space hotel? Not impossible."

echo "$PERSON1: Let me know when it’s time. I’ll bring the branding—you bring the rockets!"
