echo "Donald Trump:
Elon! Great to see you. You're doing fantastic things—tremendous, really. Space, cars, Twitter—nobody's doing it like you."

echo "Elon Musk:
Thanks, Donald. Good to see you too. You’ve definitely left your mark—big headlines, big moves."

echo "Donald Trump:
Well, you know me. I think big. But you? Rockets to Mars? Electric everything? That's huge. Maybe we should build a hotel on Mars—Trump Galactic!"

echo "Elon Musk:
One step at a time. Let’s get Starship fully operational first. But yeah, a space hotel? Not impossible."

echo "Donald Trump:
Let me know when it’s time. I’ll bring the branding—you bring the rockets!"
